# UART

The [Universional Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter) (UART for short) is an asychronous serial communication device found in most computers, often including even embedded or IoT devices. It is a ubiquoutous model/specification to allow communication between two devices through a serial port.

This crate aims for full implementation support of features from the [16550 UART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16550_UART) ([detailed specification here](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/sprugp1/sprugp1.pdf)).
